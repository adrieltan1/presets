# Productivity
Notion - All my notes are in here from my learning stuff.
NVIM - I like neovim and have been using it for journaling and random notes for a while. Slowly transitioning away from vscode into neovim for programming stuff just to see how I like it... I already use the vim emulator on VSCode anyways lol. 
Office - Microsoft's Productivity suite is still king.
WPS Office - For Linux or if I don't want to waste a license for that device.
Todoist

NDI SDK/Apps - NDI has it's issues, but the whole ecosystem is pretty useful to get content from one device to the other.
yt-dlp - Hey sometimes you need to download a Youtube Video lol.
Handbrake - A simple FFMPEG driver that is easy to use to compress videos.
Affinity Suite - A photoshop, illustrator, designer alternative 

# Coding Specific
VSCode Insiders - I use this over normal VSCode because I sometimes see new features and I wanna try them out.
IntelliJ - If I ever need java
Miniconda - For quick and dirty stuff this works great (even though it's slow af). For projects, probably poetry, for random things. Conda is great. Also prevents on from F-ing up their env easily.
