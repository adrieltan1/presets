# Dell Lattitude 5300 Setup

These are the configs I use to configure drivers to work properly on my Dell 5300. This may or may not be applicable to other machines.

## Fingerprint

The drivers for the fingerprint driver aren't installed by default. 

The deb can be found here, add it either to your repo list or just download the .deb (yes the 22.04 driver works fine)
