# Tools
- Better Touch Tool - Paid, but I use it to get three finger middle click, better window management, better touch bar, natrual scrolling for touchpad only etc... My must have app for mac laptops
- CoconutBattery - Freemium, A way for me to check the battery heath of my laptop or iOS devices
- DiskInventoryX - WinDirStat for mac
- Warp - A better AI, rust powered terminal
- AltTab - Even as someone who grew up on mac, I hate Command-Tab... I have too many windows.
- The Unarchiver - works for everything. .RAR
- Stats - I like to see my system stats on my toolbar
- MacsFanControl - Because Apple like silence over heat, but sometimes I want coolness over heat.
- OrbStack - Docker is way too heavy on mac... It's basically a drop in docker replacement + the ability to run VMs easily.
- Background Music - Adding an additional virtual sound device on my computer for streaming stuff... Not so useful now that Ventura introduced system sound capture, but still useful for some situations.
